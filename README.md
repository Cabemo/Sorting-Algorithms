# Sorting Algorithms: Implementation and Analysis

For the final project of TC2017 of ITESM we analyzed and implemented the following sorting algorithms: 

	- Bubble Sort
	- Quick Sort
	- Radix Sort
	- Heapsort
	- Mergesort 

In the [report](PDFs/Reporte.pdf) you can read the analysis --in spanish-- and each program is just a test of the sorting algorithm with a hard-coded array to sort.
